2. Train-Val-Test Subdirectory Name
 * Folder name structure: one of 'train/', 'validation/', or 'test/'
 * Contents:
    - Subset Files: .pkl files containing a subset (i.e. multiple batches) of the train/val/test set to iterate over

    - 2nd element: task_id_str+"_"; a descriptive string identifying the task for which the dataset was currated (e.g. "cdisnRP", "TS", "MYOWMined", etc)
    - 3rd element: data_source_str+"_"; a descriptive string identifying the source of the dataset (e.g. "TUHAbnormal")
    - 4th element: throttle_percent_str+"percentOfData_"+date_str; throttle_percent_str indicates the portion of the dataset used and date_str states the date the data-split was generated, formatted as YYYYMMDD
 * Contents:
    - Subdirectories: train1/, validation1/, ..., trainN/, validationN/, and (optionally) test/
    - Other:
       * dataset_configuration.pkl: a file containing a python dict object storing info such as

          - "config_args": the arguments given to the preprocessing pipeline when the split was generated
          - other info as needed
2. Train-Val-Test Subdirectory Name
 * Folder name structure: one of 'trainX/', 'validationX/', or 'test/'
 * Contents:
    - Subset Files: .pkl files containing a subset (i.e. multiple batches) of the train/val/test set to iterate over

    - 2nd element: training_type_id_str; identifies the type of train-val-test split(s) (either 'CVS' or 'SS') used to train the algorithm
    - 3rd element: data_source_str+"_"; a descriptive string identifying the source of the dataset used in the split (e.g. "TUHAbnormal")
    - 4th element: "results_"+date_str; date_str states the date the algorithm/task training was initiated, formatted as YYYYMMDD
 * Contents:
    - Subdirectories: task1ID/, task2ID/, ..., taskNID/
    - Other:
       * training_configuration.pkl: a file containing a python dict object storing info such as
          - "data_info": description of the data split(s) used in training
          - "config_args": the arguments given to the training pipeline when training was initiated
